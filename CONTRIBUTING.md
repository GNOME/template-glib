# Contributing to Template-GLib

This project is very new.
Take a look around and see if there is anything you'd like to work on.
Report bugs to me any way you know how.
Email, github, bugzilla (in gnome-builder project), etc.

## Coding Style

We follow the GLib and Gtk+ coding style, which is roughly GNU C89.
Please don't use the new g_auto() and g_autoptr() since we would like
this to work on other platforms without much effort.
